# React Popout Component

-   Status: this fork should be considered work in progress
-   Objective: feature parity: OpenFin & web browser windows

This is a React component designed for React 16 with complete Typescript support.

## Features

1. This is developed along side with the React 16 fix to allow mounting across frames _even for Edge and IE_ browsers
2. Typescript support for all the options (especially hard to remember window features)
3. Reflects style-loader injected styles from the main window to the children window

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ewmarkets/react-popout-component
```

or

```sh
yarn add @ewmarkets/react-popout-component
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popout } from "@ewmarkets/react-popout-component";

export default class App extends React.Component<any, any> {
    constructor(props: any) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { showPopout: false };
    }

    onClick = () => {
        this.setState({ showPopout: true });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Now you too have the power to POP OUT</h1>
                <button onClick={this.onClick}>POP IT OUT!</button>
                {this.state.showPopout && (
                    <Popout>
                        <div>You can put anything here!</div>
                    </Popout>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

## API

PopOut Component has the following props:

```ts
export interface PopoutProps {
    hidden?: boolean;
    name?: string;  // refers to the window.name attribute
    title?: string; // refers to the document.title attribute (use this to give your new window's title bar a proper name!)
    onClose?: () => void;
    onBeforeUnload?: (evt: BeforeUnloadEvent) => string | null | undefined;
    children?: any;
    options?: Partial<WindowFeaturesOptions>;
    html?: string;
}
```

The `options` prop is of the following type:

```ts
export interface WindowFeaturesOptions {
    left: number;
    top: number;
    height: number;
    width: number;
    menubar: boolean;
    toolbar: boolean;
    location: boolean;
    status: boolean;
    resizable: boolean;
    scrollbars: boolean;
}
```

## Injection Mode

This component works well for both modes of style loading:

1. Appending Style blocks (e.g. style-loader)
2. Manual insertRule() into a CSSStyleSheet

For the second case with insertRule(), since there is nothing that can observe the insert event, a callback must be registered when a
rule is inserted. For an example usage with the Microsoft [Office Fabric](https://github.com/officedev/office-ui-fabric-react),
set it up as a global like so:

```js
import { insertPopoutStylesheetRule } from "@ewmarkets/react-popout-component";

window.FabricConfig = {
    mergeStyles: {
        onInsertRule: insertPopoutStylesheetRule,
    },
};
```
